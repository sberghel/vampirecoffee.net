+++

Some information in Fallout 4 can only be gleaned from the loading screens,
which are random. If, for example, you haven't seen the loading screen tip on
Sentry Bots, you are going to have a really hard time fighting Sentry Bots.
So I've compiled the following list of tips from the loading screens. I extracted
all this information with FO4edit. Tips that fit under multiple headers - such as
the tip for "Attack Dog", a perk that affects Dogmeat - have been duplicated so
that they appear once under each header.

Note: the flavor text tips may contain spoilers.

### Useful Tips

#### Enemies / Creatures / Robots

* Most Mirelurks are heavily armored  and resistant to most forms of damage, but their faces are vulnerable.
* Super Mutants are stronger and more resilient than humans, and consider themselves the Commonwealth's superior race.
* Mole Rats often travel underground and then burst through the surface to ambush their prey.
* The Assaultron robot was constructed by RobCo and sold to the U.S. military as a frontline wartime combatant. It is fast and deadly at close range, and employs a devastating laser at a distance. Some units can even employ stealth technology.
* One of the Wasteland's most disgusting creatures, the Bloatfly shoots its maggots as projectiles, and often explodes upon death.
* Not only do Bloodbugs suck the blood of their victims, but they will often shoot it back at them, causing distorted vision.
* The Sentry Bot is one of the most dangerous robots ever created, and utilizes a variety of heavy weapons systems to destroy its enemies. Upon death, it erupts in a devastating explosion.
* Automated Turrets will track and attack their targets relentlessly, but can often be reprogrammed from a nearby computer terminal.
* The firefighter model of Protectron is equipped with an internal cryo gun it can utilize in any combat situation.
* The medic model of Protectron was designed to use its hands as a defibrillator. In combat, it utilizes this ability as a painful shock attack.
* The construction model of Protectron was built to take damage. Some versions also come equipped with an internal nail gun, which they can utilize in combat.
* Because of its size, the Sentry Bot generates a significant amount of heat. During combat, it will occasionally enter a "cooldown" state. When this happens, the Sentry Bot's back panel will open, exposing its Fusion Core ... and presenting the best moment to strike.
* Robots tend to get more dangerous as they get more damaged. When both their arms are disabled, most robots will then charge at an opponent while initiating a self-destruct sequence, and explode in a final fiery attack.
* In combat, the police model of Protectron relies on strong melee attacks and a painful electric shock.
* Some creatures, like the Mirelurk King, Chameleon Deathclaw, and Sentry Bot, can utilize stealth to turn themselves almost invisible and ambush unwary prey.

#### Combat

* Melee attacks on enemies can stagger them, interrupting their attacks.
* Want to prevent an enemy from fleeing? Cripple the legs.[^1]
* Actively blocking against a melee attacker might cause them to recoil, and render their attack useless.
* Actively blocking against a melee attacker might cause them to recoil, and deal no damage.
* Weapons and creatures can deliver four different types of damage: Ballistic, Energy, Radiation, and Poison. Some enemies are naturally resistant against certain forms of damage, but specialized armor can also offer the same protection.
* Use the bash button to deliver a melee attack with any ranged weapon.
* Some weapons can completely disintegrate or "gooify" an enemy upon death. Don't worry - you can still retrieve any loot from their pile of ashes. Or ... puddle.
* When you set off a hostile mine, it will begin beeping a rapid countdown before exploding. If you're quick enough, you can activate the mine within that time to disarm it.

[^1]: This also prevents enemies with melee attacks (like Feral Ghouls) from getting close enough to attack you.

#### Weapons

* The Gauss Rifle uses magnetic induction to propel a projectile at incredible and devastating speed. Each shot can be "charged" for maximum damage by keeping the trigger held in for a moment before releasing.
* The Laser Musket combines high-tech energy damage with Revolutionary style. Each crank of its handle loads additional Fusion Cell ammo, and the weapon can be cranked multiple times to increase the damage of a single shot.
* Guns with long barrels have increased accuracy when aimed, but decreased accuracy when shot "from the hip".
* Weapon mods that increase weight also increase the time it takes to aim.
* Want to significantly increase your weapon's melee damage? Add a bayonet.
* The Gamma Gun emits radiation that is deadly to humans, but ineffective against almost all Ghouls, robots, and Wasteland creatures.
* Specially constructed from the severed appendage of a dead Deathclaw, the Deathclaw Gauntlet allows its user to viciously slash at enemies for incredibly high damage.
* The Flamer is a specially engineered flamethrower suited for extended combat engagements. It delivers sustained energy damage and can completely immolate a target.
* While capable of dealing a massive amount of ballistic damage in a short period of time, the Minigun needs a moment to "spin up" before it can be fired.
* While capable of dealing a massive amount of ballistic damage in a short period of time, the Laser Gatling needs a moment to "spin up" before it can be fired.
* Because of the "spread" inherent in this class of weapon, shotguns do more damage the closer they are to the target.
* To throw a grenade or Molotov cocktail, first equip it, and then hold the Bash/Power Attack button.
* Laser rifles and pistols deal powerful energy damage, and can completely disintegrate defeated foes.
* Plasma rifles and pistols deal even more damage than laser weapons, and can "gooify" defeated foes.
* Sick of carrying around all that useless stuff? Load it into the Junk Jet, and shoot it at unsuspecting enemies. You haven't lived until you've killed someone with a teddy bear.
* The Cryolater is a powerful prototype rifle that can completely freeze enemies.
* A suppressor will reduce both the sound and recoil of a gun.
* Muzzle brakes and compensators help reduce the recoil on automatic weapons.


#### Armor

* Combat Armor offers balanced protection against both energy and ballistic damage.
* Power Armor can be enhanced with a variety of mods that add specialized functionality, like a jet boost, Tesla damage field, explosive impact landing, integrated Stealth Boy, and auto Stimpacks.

* Each companion has their own likes and dislikes. Some actions will earn their respect. Others, their disappointment.
* If a companion goes down in combat, use a Stimpak on them to bring them back into the fight.

#### Settlements, Workshops, and Crafting

* The higher the Happiness of your workshop settlements, the more productive their settlers.

#### Stealth

* Crouching will both improve your accuracy and activate sneak mode.
* While it's great for illuminating dark areas, the light generated from your Pip-Boy light actually makes you less stealthy. If you want to effectively sneak, turn it off.

* For fast, effective healing of both overall health and every injured body part, nothing beats a Stimpak.

* Created before the war as a general performance enhancer, X-Cell never got out of the prototype stage, but was widely distributed on the black market. It boosts every SPECIAL attribute for a limited period of time, but is highly addictive.

* Med-X is a powerful pain killer that effectively increases Damage Resistance for a limited period of time.
* As rare as it is powerful, Addictol completely cures its user of all addictions.[^3]

[^3]: Most doctors will sell it to you, so Bethesda is using an odd definition of "rare" here.

#### Misc

* If you have too many quest targets, check the Quests section of your Pip-Boy to see if you have more than one active quest. In the Miscellaneous category, you can turn each objective on and off.
* You can run faster with your weapon holstered, and fastest when sprinting.
* Press and hold the Pip-Boy button to turn on its light and illuminate dark areas.
* Once you discover a location, you can use your map to fast travel back to it. Normally, you must be outside to do so, but there are exceptions.[^4]
* Successful attacks in VATS fill your Critical meter. Once it's completely filled, you can unleash a devastating attack.
* Heavier weapons typically deal more damage, but take up more weight in your inventory, and slow you down when they're equipped.
* Zooming in with a ranged weapon slows you down, but improves your accuracy.
* If you start a fight you can't finish, try putting away your weapon. There's a slight chance your opponent just might forgive you...
* You can restore health by using a Stimpak, eating food, visiting a doctor, drinking from a water source, or sleeping in a bed.
* Sleeping in any bed will fully restore your Health and heal any crippled body parts.
* Drinking from a water source is always a tactical choice - you will usually restore lost Health, but raise your radiation level.
* Sleeping in a rented or owned bed will give you a "Well Rested" bonus that boosts your earned XP for a limited time.
* Combat too hard or too easy? You can change the game's difficulty at any time.
* Use the Pip-Boy to tune into different radio stations. If you close the Pip-Boy while the radio is on, it will continue playing until you go back into the Pip-Boy and turn it off.
* Need a real challenge? Try Survival difficulty. Health restoration will be severely reduced.
* The higher the difficulty setting, the greater your chance of finding Legendary items.
* Every time you level up, your Health increases and you get to choose a new perk.
* Pre-war military checkpoints, scattered throughout the Commonwealth, are a great place to find Fusion Cores.

* Successful attacks in VATS build your Critical meter. Once the meter is filled, you can unleash a devastating attack.[^5]
* When you steal an item, the owner will generally attempt to take it back from you. If they can't, they may attack.
* To cure addiction, visit a doctor in any major settlement.
* Doctors, located in most settlements, provide a variety of services. They can heal all wounds (including crippled limbs), cure radiation damage, and cure addiction to chems and alcohol. Most of them also sell medical supplies.
* Want to change your hairstyle? Visit a barber in one of the major settlements.
* Tired of the same old look? A reconstructive surgeon can give you a whole new face...
* When you get a new quest, it will not become active unless you have no other active quests. Check the Quests section in your Pip-Boy to see which quests are active.
* Most shops are active during daylight hours, and closed at night.
* Adhesive is rare[^6], and used to create nearly every mod.
* Sleeping in a bed when your romantic companion is nearby will grant the Lover's Embrace perk, which grants a significant boost to any earned XP for a limited time.
* Need to pass some time in a hurry? Using any piece[^7] of unowned furniture will allow you to "Wait" for up to 24 hours.
* The Commonwealth is a dangerous place, but tends to get considerably more dangerous the farther south you travel...
* If there's a skull displayed next to an enemy's name, it means they're several levels higher than you, and may be difficult to defeat in combat. In such cases, running away and returning when you're stronger might be the wisest course of action.
* Grown attached to a weapon? Give it a custom name at any Weapons Workbench.

[^4]: The only exception I've found so far is the Railroad Headquarters - but see the "Useful, But Slightly Spoilery" section.

[^5]: This tip appears twice with slightly different wording.

[^6]: You can make adhesive from corn, mutfruit, and tatos, so again, this is an odd definition of "rare".

[^7]: This doesn't work with restaurant booths.

### Useful, But Slightly Spoilery

* To enter and exit the Institute, simply fast travel to and from using the map. This ability is only available if you stay in the Institute's good graces.
* Use the Flare Gun to summon help from any nearby Minutemen.
* Use Artillery Smoke Grenades to call in artillery strikes from nearby Minutemen batteries.
* The Verfibird Signal Grenade can be used to call in a friendly vertibird for transport.

#### Brotherhood Of Steel

* Piloted by Lancer-Captain Kells, the Prydwen has traveled extensively along the East Coast ... but this is its first journey to the Commonwealth.
* While the Prydwen does not have any actual weapons systems, it always carries enough troops, vertibirds, and supplies to mount a major offensive.
* The Brotherhood of Steel is dedicated to the advancement of humanity, and views mutations as a scourge. Super Mutants, Ghouls, and other "abominations" have been deemed impure, and must be eradicated.
* To the Brotherhood of Steel, the Gen 3 synths, which are indistinguishable from humans, are a perfect example of science run amok - a technology that cannot be fully controlled by humans.

#### The Institute

* The Institute is actually an advanced subterranean metropolis, a technological marvel unlike anything seen on the surface of the Commonwealth.
* Many people in the Commonwealth view the Institute as the "boogeyman", living in the shadows, striking out anywhere, at any time.
* For the people of the Commonwealth, the idea of someone they know being replaced by an Institute synth is a very real threat.
* According to local history, the Institute formed from the remains of C.I.T., the Commonwealth Institute of Technology. But the college itself has lain in ruins for more than two centuries.
* Long ago, when the Institute created their first synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth. Mutual mistrust ended that relationship quickly.
* The Courser Chip is the key to infiltrating the Institute. But first, it must be decoded...
* Inside every synth Courser is a specialized chip that is instrumental in "relaying" into the Institute. Obtaining that chip is the first step in infiltrating the shadowy organization.
* The Institute was officially founded in the year 2110 by a group of former Commonwealth Institute of Technology students who took refuge in the college's underground level at the time of the Great War.
* After developing the Molecular Relay, an advanced teleportation device, the Institute sealed off access to the surface and began their campaign of underground expansion.
* The Institute often sends its synths to the surface to scavenge for usable materials. The affect [sic] this has on the Commonwealth, or its people, is not a priority ...
* Institute scientists rarely leave the safety and comfort of their underground utopia. If there are experiments to be conducted on the surface, they are generally carried out by synths.
* The Institute is ruled by a Directorate, made up of the individual heads of each division, and one specially-appointed Director.
* The BioScience division produces the majority of the Institute's food, but also carries out a number of other, sometimes secret, projects.
* The Advanced Systems division is responsible for developing the original Molecular Relay, nearly one hundred years ago.
* The Synth Retention Bureau is tasked with the retrieval of "escaped" Gen 3 synths - malfunctioning units whose self-aware AI has convinced them that they are, in fact, alive.
* The Institute's experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV, ended when Doctor Virgil went rogue and fled into the Commonwealth.
* The Institute is convinced that the surface of the Commonwealth is doomed, and the true future of the human race lies underground.
* The Institute allows humans to live in a clean, safe, comfortable environment, free from the strife and environmental hazards that have rendered the surface nearly uninhabitable.
* Before the war, C.I.T. conducted experiments in its underground nuclear reactor. Today, it has been repurposed, and once activated will provide the Institute with nearly limitless power.

#### The Railroad

* The only group in the Commonwealth willing to actually fight the Institute is the Railroad, an organization almost as secretive as the Institute itself.
* No one knows just how powerful the Railroad is, or if they even possess the means to defeat their sworn enemy - the Institute.
* The crypt beneath the Old North Church once contained the bones of more than 1000 Bostonians buried in the 19th and 18th centuries. Today it serves as headquarters for the enigmatic Railroad, a group dedicated to saving Synths and destroying the Institute.
* The Institute discovered the Railroad's previous headquarters, and nearly destroyed the group in the process. If the current HQ were to be discovered, it would prove disastrous.
* Railroad agents communicate via "railsigns", secret symbols scrawled throughout the Commonwealth that indicates dangers, allies, and even the occasional cache of goods.
* The Railroad relies on safehouses to hide runaway synths and resupply agents in the field.
* What the Railroad lacks in numbers they make up for in subterfuge. They rely on secrecy and intelligence gathering to tip the odds in their fight against the Institute.
* A "heavy" is a Railroad agent tasked with brining the fight directly to the Institute. Their training prepares them for the most difficult and dangerous assignments available.
* While the Railroad's primary enemy is the Institute, they are also dedicated to battling the general hatred of synths that has spread throughout the Commonwealth.
* P.A.M., or the Predictive Analytical Machine, is a unique robot with advanced artificial intelligence, originally buitl to predict and stop a nuclear war. While she ultimately failed in that duty, P.A.M. has proven instrumental to the Railroad's operations.

#### The Minutemen

* The Minutemen once made their headquarters in South Boston's Fort Independence, also known as "The Castle". That ended when a giant creature rose from the sea decades ago and laid it to waste.
* The Minutemen were formed over a century ago by ordinary people who simply wanted to defend their home, the Commonwealth, from any threat imaginable. Sadly, the group has fallen into disarray in recent years.
* Radio Freedom is the radio station of the Minutemen, and allows them to broadcast alerts all across the Commonwealth from their headquarters in the Castle.
* Fort Independence was named in 1797, at a ceremony presided over by President John Adams. Before then, it was known as Castle William, and then Fort Adams. Before its destruction in 2240, the fortification served as an apt headquarters for the Minutemen.
* The Minutement first rose to prominence in the year 2180, when they defended Diamond City against a horde of Super Mutant attackers.
* Like the Minutemen of the Revolutionary era, the modern day Minutemen are dedicated to defending the people of Massachusetts, at a minute's notice.
