When people talk about global warming, they say things like ["models predict 
that Earth will warm between 2 and 6 degrees Celsius in the next century"](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page3.php). 
But what does that mean? I can't tell the difference between 74째 F and 76째 F,
or between 23째 C and 25째 C. Is a two-degree change in global temperature really
that important?

Yes.

We'll look at two periods in time when the global temperature was within 10 degrees
(Celsius) of what it is now -- the Ice Age and the Cretaceous.

### The Ice Age

Scientists can estimate global temperatures by [examining ice cores taken from
the South pole](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Paleoclimatology_IceCores/).
They estimate that during the Ice Age, the Earth was [4 to 7 degrees (Celsius) cooler](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page3.php)
than it is today.

Here's what that four to seven degree change in temperature gave us:

* Europe, now largely glacier-free, had glaciers extending [into modern Poland and Germany](http://www.skb.se/upload/publications/pdf/TR-06-36.pdf) during the last ice age.
* In North America, glaciers reached into [what is now Arizona](http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/files/norock/products/RockiesGlaciationQuatUS.pdf).
* In South America, there were glaciers in [Venezuela](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073810001570), and an ice sheet [covered the Southern Andes](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02118#ref11) 
up to the [modern location of the Northern Patagonian Ice Field](https://www.google.com/maps/place//@-47,-73.5,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0!5m1!1e4?hl=en).
* Global dust levels were [25 times higher](http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2008/0403/p14s01-sten.html) during the last ice age.
* Sea levels were low enough that Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea were [one landmass](https://books.google.com/books?id=v8snORKmQRgC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=sahulland&source=bl&ots=L9wiPEAXzC&sig=gKMIsbXttHbrll12xrdqWe_9WuQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlw43b69zJAhVMzGMKHSQDB5cQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q=sahulland&f=false), which geologists call Sahulland.
* North America had [cheetahs](http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/_extinct/cheetah1_american/cheetah1_american.html) and [lions](http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2010/05/08/the_american_lion_is_not_a_lio/)[^1]. Herds of [mammoths](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/05/mammoths/mueller-text) lived in modern Russia and across North America, and they went far enough south that they were caught in [the La Brea tar pits](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/labrea.html), along with saber-toothed tigers.

[^1]: Or possibly very large jaguars.

When the global temperature rose, glaciers in North America receded to form 
[the Great Lakes](https://books.google.com/books?id=arfWRW5OFVgC&pg=RA1-PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [Niagara Falls](http://www.niagaraparks.com/about-niagara-falls/geology-facts-figures.html). Animals that
lived in tundra conditions could no longer survive in what is now Southern California.

Again: all of these changes were accompanied by a global rise in temperature of
four to seven degrees Celsius. It's a small enough change that I wouldn't touch
my thermostat.

### The Cretaceous

The Cretaceous period, at its warmest, was [8 to 10 degrees (Celsius) warmer](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFMPP33C..04F)
than today, and during more moderate periods was [6 to 8 degrees warmer](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFMPP33C..04F).

During the Cretaceous: 

* [Forests extended into the North and South Poles.](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-12378934)
There were even polar dinosaurs. 
* Sea levels were so high that [much of the modern United States was underwater](http://www.carnegiemnh.org/online/mesozoic/sea-level.html).
* The Western Interior Seaway [connected the modern Canadian Arctic sea with what
is now the Gulf of Mexico](http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/research/sageman/PDF/94.Sageman%26Arthur.pdf).
* There was [nearly twice as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there is today](http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/3/329.full).

The Cretaceous also had wildly different lifeforms than the modern Earth, but 
[it is unlikely that climate change was the only reason they went extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event).

### Conclusion

Given that efforts to stem climate change are severely underfunded, I
recommend beating the rush and:

* buying a summer home in Siberia
* starting a farm in Nunavut
* building beachside resorts in Kentucky and Montana
* learning how to be self-sufficient while living in a houseboat

A six-degree change in global temperature is _very, very bad_.
